# Facial-Expression-Classifier
By Joseph Liu and Marin Azhar

This is a Image Classification project that we did during CUNY Tech Prep's Data Science Track. It is a web application that classifies human faces as either happy or sad.

The data was requested from [Real-world Affective Faces Database](http://www.whdeng.cn/RAF/model1.html)
